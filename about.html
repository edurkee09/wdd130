     <p>Hi! I am from Charlotte, North Carolina. My parents just moved to Panama City Beach, Florida about a year ago so I guess I could also say I'm from there as well. 
        My major is software engineering and I'm so excited to learn and develop my understanding of code. I am a junior here, it has taken me a while to figure out 
        what exactly I wanted to be doing. I've tried architecture and elementary education but found that those weren't the career paths I wanted to go down.</p>
     <p>I love to travel and do basically anything outdoors. I have been to almost every state and have travelled to Brazil a few times to visit family. I hope to
        one day be able to travel the world. I just want to be able to know that I have seen almost every beautiful place and met as many beautiful people as possible. 
        My favorite place that I have been to would probably be Rio, it's such an intense feeling to see views that you have only seen in pictures or movies, and that
        view from the statue of Christ the Redeemer gave that to me. I also really enjoy hiking, hammocking and anything in the ocean. I also really enjoy watching 
        shows and movies, some of my favorites are anything Star Wars, Marvel and anime.</p>
